CURRENTLY A PROTOTYPE. VERY UNFINISHED.

This project is a javascript/CSS library that makes 3d graphics on the web extremely simple. 

# Current Features
perspective-box turns your element into a 3d box
perspective-fade copies your element and fades it into z-space

# Known Bugs
Z buffer is off for some background 3d objects.
padding doesnt work
